# Data editor How To

Data editor is the tool that contributors and editors use to view the uploaded data and edit them to make the dataset valid - i.e. transform the data to a format that complies with the requirements of the Spider Trait Database data model. This document is a practical How To guide on using the data editor. You might also want to read the [full overview of the data submission process](data-submission.md).

## Data editor capabilites

The types of edit that can be done using the data editor are:

+ Providng a missing required value
+ Replacing an unrecognized value with a value from an enumeration list (e.g. fixing typos, replacing synonyms)
+ Replacing unparsable value with a valid representation (numbers, timestamps, coordinates)
+ Deleting records that can't be made valid
+ Creating new entites (references, locations, methods, traits) - editors only

## Viewing existing unprocessed datasets

The entry point to data submission process is a list of submitted datasets. Contributors can view their submitted datasets here or add new ones. The list is located in the top menu under `Contribute` -> `Import datasets`.
